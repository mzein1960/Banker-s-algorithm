# Banker-s-algorithm
*Implementation:
To implement the Banker's algorithm, I have used C# programming language with the help of Windows Form GUI.
In this app the user can input :
1-Number of processes
2-Number of resources 
3-available resources 
4-details of each process using text boxes and buttons provided in the GUI
5-After inputting the required data, the program checks if the system is in a safe state or not using the Banker's algorithm.

*Conclusion:
In conclusion, this project demonstrates how the Banker's algorithm can be implemented using C# programming language and a Windows Form GUI.
The program allows the user to input the required data and checks if the system is in a safe state or not.

*VERY IMPORTANT NOTE :
--> WHEN entre the available or allocation or max resources must entre space between numbers like: 123 must be 1 2 3
because the problem when ente number like that: 1023 ,the system cannot know if 10 is ten or 1 and 0 so to avoid this problem must entre space between numbers
